# This Portfolio

This portfolio uses my GitHub as its data storage. It pulls my repos using the graphql API, and filters them so that only repositories with a PORTFOLIO.md in the master branch are shown.

While more work upfront, making this a reflection of my github repositories allows me to forget about it and it will stay up to date with my latest projects, all I have to do is create a markdown file and it will show up on the site.  

Front end is a server-rendered React application that is completely usable on the initial html render. Works fine with scripts disabled.

Back end is a simple node express application.
