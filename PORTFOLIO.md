# This Portfolio

My goal with this project was to revamp my porfolio and to put in practice what I have learned in the past few years.  

It is a server rendered React application that is completely usable on the initial html render. It also works with scripts disabled.

The applicatio pulls all my public repos from GitHub's graphql API. It looks for PORTFOLIO.md in the master branch, and fallbacks to README.md or the name and description fields. 

While more work upfront, making this a reflection of my github repositories allows me to forget about it and it will stay up to date with my latest projects.
