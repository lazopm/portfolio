# This Portfolio

The projects in this page are a reflection of my Github repositories. I pull Github repository data server-side using their graphql API, and filters them so that only repositories with a PORTFOLIO.md in the master branch are shown.

While more work upfront, making this a reflection of my github repositories allows me to forget about it and it will stay up to date with my latest projects as I work on Github, all I have to do is create a markdown file and it will show up on this site.  

Front end is a server-rendered React application that is completely usable on the initial html render. Works fine with scripts disabled.
